# Mendix Tree Table

Mendix Tree Table using [Ant Design Table](https://ant.design/components/table/) (MIT License).

![logo](/assets/AppStoreIcon.png)

Show a tree-like structure in Mendix.

![preview](/assets/preview.png)

> See test-project [https://reacttreeview-sandbox.mxapps.io/](https://reacttreeview-sandbox.mxapps.io/) for a live demo! This project is also used for all E2E tests. See at the bottom of this README a preview of the domain model

## Features

- Display a tree structure in a table
- DataSource:
  - Root:
    - Xpath
    - Microflow
    - Nanoflow
  - Children:
    - Reference
    - Microflow
    - Nanoflow
- Row classes
- Row icons
- Select row/rows
- Dynamic columns
- Much more...

> This widget is only ~500Kb uncompressed, so in your cloud environment this would be about ~130Kb. This is light-weight for any project.

Tested:
- IE11
- Chrome,Firefox,Safari
- Should work on Mobile Web, but might not be very usable

## Basic configuration

### 1. Data
![Data](/assets/tab01-data.png)

- Select an Entity that will serve as your Node.
- Nodes can be retrieved through a few methods: Xpath, Microflow, Nanoflow
- Please note that this only loads the top-level data (first nodes)
- When you set this to XPath, define your constraint (if needed)
- Microflow & Nanoflow should return a list of Nodes

### 2. Children
![Children](/assets/tab02-children.png)

- You do not have to load children if you just want to load a flat list
- If you load children, it can be done in two ways:
  - Child reference: Your Node should have a self-reference, as a reference set (so a many-to-many relation). You define this reference, the widget will take care of checking if it has children or not and load them when opening the parent
  - Microflow/Nanoflow: Your Node should have an attribute that tells whether or not it has children. This can be accomplished during the creation of your nodes, or a calculated attribute. If the widget sees a node has a child it will load the children.

### 3. Columns
![Columns](/assets/tab03-columns.png)

- Easiest way to configure columns is a list. This is a sorted list of all the attributes you want to show in the table. See **3.1 Columns List**
- If you want to do this dynamically (because your client wants to configure it), please look at **4. Columns**

#### 3.1. Column List
![Columns sub](/assets/tab03-columns-sub.png)

- A column should have a caption (shown at the top) and an attribute (to display the value)
- If you need to transform your value client-side, you can use a Transform Nanoflow. This should always return a string
- In the column UI tab you can set the width of the column (as '100', '25%' etc)
- You can also set a class name

### 4. Dynamic Columns
![Dynamic Columns](/assets/tab04-dynamic-columns.png)

- Dynamic columns can be used to let the user define their column. This is a bit tricky though:
  - The attribute of the Node entity should be saved in the Attribute attribute of the column Entity (this is confusing, right ðŸ˜œ?).
- All other attributes should be straightforward.

Note:

In order to get the attributes of your Node entity in your project, I encourage you to use the [Model Reflection module in the AppStore](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/69/). This has the ability to load all entities and read their attributes. Then use this to create your Column entities.

### Events
![Events](/assets/tab05-events.png)

- Events are pretty straightforward. The widget uses a debounce, which means it will not single click when you double-click.

### UI
![UI](/assets/tab06-ui.png)

- The size changes the padding in the cells
- Header row (which contains the captions of the column) can be disabled
- You can set a class on the row through an attribute in your Node. This way it is possible to change colors (needs custom styling)
- Icons can be shown on the first column of the row. See test-project

### Selection
![Selection](/assets/tab07-selection.png)

- Just like a normal table, you can use selection to do things with the Nodes.
- Configure buttons for a selection.
- **Note: Due to limitations you will need to set a different microflow for a single or multi selection. Still working on this feature.**

## Test-project

The [test-project](https://reacttreeview-sandbox.mxapps.io/) uses the following domain model. This is purely an example, but can be used as an inspiration to use in your own project:
